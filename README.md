# DIGIT-110-AJC-Survey
Launched as a student semester project for DIGIT 110: Text Encoding at Penn State Behrend
This is a project to apply TEI XML code to represent the responses of Dr. Anna Julia Cooper to a survey of African American college graduates in 1930: to represent in text-searchable form both the survey questions and Cooper's responses. 

For more about the project, see <https://newtfire.github.io/Anna-Julia-Cooper_Survey_Edition/>.
